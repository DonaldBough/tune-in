# tune-in
A radio for $TUNE songs from the etherium blockchain. 

## Vision
A pirate radio exclusive to $TUNE nft owners. Listen to other songs created by artists for their own $TUNE.

## Implementation Ideas 
@aeolus
- As an initial MVP, only log in with metamask for people who own a tune NFT. 
- We can host the music on IPFS. 
- Everything that interacts with the NFT along with metadata and such can be done via web3.js. 

@donaldbough
- Actual radio station website hosted from a regular web2 web server (firebase hosting's easy + generous free layer).
- Need to look into IPFS media player libraries to play the song in our radio station website.

@sudo
- TUNES metadata could have a link for the song in Sound Cloud or Spotify.
- Soundcloud links would be a great since we could stream them via api, and have an MVP.
